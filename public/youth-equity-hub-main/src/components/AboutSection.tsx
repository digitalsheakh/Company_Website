                Educate2Youth is for everyone who believes in building a fairer education system. 
                At our core, we are a youth-led organisation working to expose and tackle the disparities 
                in knowledge, resources, and opportunities that exist between communities of different 
                socio-economic backgrounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                We foster and lead targeted campaigns that push for meaningful change in education. 
                Our current flagship campaign, <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Every Child's Chance</span>, 
                advocates for equitable funding of extracurricular activities - because opportunity 
                shouldn't depend on your postcode.

                  We envision a world where every young person has equal access to knowledge, 
                  opportunities, and the confidence to shape their future - regardless of their 
                  socio-economic background.

                  While the national curriculum may be the same, the system is not. Financial and 
                  emotional barriers often make key resources inaccessible, especially for those 
                  in underserved communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This inequality shapes mindsets: young people in well-resourced areas are encouraged 
                  to be ambitious and aspirational, while those in less affluent communities are too 
                  often made to feel like their potential has a ceiling.

                  Educate2Youth exists to challenge and dismantle the limitations society places 
                  on young people based on their background. We strive to build a world where 
                  no one's potential is defined by their postcode or background.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through awareness-raising, inclusive advocacy, and a relentless belief in the 
                  power of young people, we are working towards a future where every youth - 
                  regardless of where they come from - can believe in, pursue, and achieve their 
                  full potential.
