## üìù How to Add New Blog Posts

### Current Method (Simple - No CMS Yet)

Right now, blog posts are stored directly in the code. To add a new post:

**Step 1:** Open this file:
```
/src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
```

**Step 2:** Add your new post to the `blogPosts` object:

```typescript
'your-blog-post-slug': {
  title: 'Your Blog Post Title',
  excerpt: 'Short description (150-160 characters)',
  date: '2025-10-05',
  category: 'Website Development', // or App Development, Digital Marketing, SEO
  author: 'Digital Sheakh Team',
  readTime: '5 min read',
  content: `
# Your Blog Post Title

Your content here in Markdown format...

## Section Heading

Paragraph text...

### Subsection

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

**Bold text** for emphasis.

[Call to Action Button](#contact)
  `
}
```

**Step 3:** Also add it to the listing in `/src/app/blog/page.tsx`:

```typescript
{
  id: 5,
  title: 'Your Blog Post Title',
  slug: 'your-blog-post-slug',
  excerpt: 'Short description',
  date: '2025-10-05',
  category: 'Website Development',
  author: 'Digital Sheakh Team',
  readTime: '5 min read',
}
```

**Step 4:** Commit and push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new blog post: Your Title"
git push origin main
```
