# Why SEO Matters for Your Business in 2025

In today's digital world, having a website isn't enough. You need to be found by potential customers when they search on Google. That's where **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** comes in.

## What is SEO?

SEO is the practice of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results. When someone searches for "website development in Bangladesh," you want your business to appear on the first page.

## Why SEO is Important

### 1. Increased Visibility

75% of users never scroll past the first page of search results. If you're not on page 1, you're invisible to most potential customers.

### 2. More Organic Traffic

SEO brings free, targeted traffic to your website. Unlike paid ads, organic traffic continues even when you're not actively spending money.

### 3. Better ROI

SEO provides one of the best returns on investment compared to other marketing channels.
